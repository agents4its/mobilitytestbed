**MobilityTestbed** is an interaction-rich simulation model designed to test and **evaluate** various **DARP algorithms** (Dial-A-Ride Problem) or other, central or decentralized, coordination or resource-allocation mechanisms within on-demand transportation systems. The testbed is built on top of the [AgentPolis](http://agentpolis.com/) platform.


It allows users to:
* easily plug in **their own algorithms**, 
* run them in different realistic **benchmark scenarios**, 
* **visualize** the runs,
* discover the **weaknesses and strengths** of their algorithms
* and **compare** their **performance** with the alternatives.
